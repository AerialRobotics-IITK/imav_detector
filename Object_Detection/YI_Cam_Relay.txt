    b) 'nmap -sP 192.168.42.0/24' : shows active IPS, one is your pc's, the other is the camera's
    c) the camera IP should generally be 192.168.42.1, if not replace it with previous command's output below
        'nc -vvn 192.168.42.1 7878' : connects to port 7878 on the camera
    d) '{"msg_id":257,"token":0",param":0}' : sends message to camera
